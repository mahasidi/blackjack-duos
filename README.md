<b>Project Name</b>: BlackJack Duos

<b>Project Concept</b>: BlackJack Duos is a two player adaptation of the classic Blackjack game, designed for the MakeCode platform. Unlike traditional Blackjack, this version does not involve a dealer. Instead, both players take turns playing against each other, aiming to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting).

<b>Game Rules & Controls</b>:

<ul>
<li>Press B to ‘Hit’ (Draw a new card).</li>

<li>Press A to ‘Stay’ (End your turn).</li>

<li>One player plays at a time.</li>

<li>The total score is displayed in real-time as each player plays.</li>

<li>Once Player 2 is done, both scores are compared.</li>

<li>The screen will display the winner (P1 or P2) and indicate if either player has busted.</li>

<li>Celebratory music plays once a player wins.</li>

<li>Press A+B to reset the game.</li>
</ul>

The game is played using a custom laser printed Wild-West themed controller, enhancing the aesthetic and feel of the experience.
